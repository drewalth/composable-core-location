Any and all contributions are welcome! This project is just starting and does not include all of the `CLLocationManagerDelegate` methods. If you're interested in helping fill in the gaps, please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

If creating a PR, please follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. Eventually, I'd like to add automated versioning.
